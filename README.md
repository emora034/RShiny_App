# RShiny_App

The purpose of this app is for the user to have an interactive experience throughout. The datasets are extarcted directly from the government website, so that any user may access it at any time. 

The datasets provide the both the generation capacity and the recorded generated energy given a particular source, for the State of Maryland. It can be observed that most renewable energy sources, both generation and capacity, have increased significantly thorughout the years.

Although renewable energy has become increasingly more popular and accessible, it still represents a very low portion of the overall energy generated and consumed - from the generation data, it can be observed that, all together, the renewable energy sources represent less than 10% of the energy generated in the State.

The first tab of the app introduces the data to the user, then the user can select the dataset to be loaded through the Data tab. Lastly, the last two tabs allow the user to plot the datasets individually while selecting the years he/she wishes to analyze.
